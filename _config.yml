# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  <p>I'm a senior web developer for the World Resources Institute in Washington DC. As a full stack developer I focus on technical 
  architecture and strategy as well as managing our development process and dev ops. My site development work focuses on lean UX, 
  responsive design, and usability.</p>
  <p>Recent presentations include a session at the 2016 edUI Conference on the challenges of building an API-based 'open hours' tool 
  for universities, and sessions on 'demystifying the web' at the Geoergtown Day School STEM/STEAM Conference for high school students in DC.</p>
