<h3>Web Development</h3>

I'm a full stack Drupal developer for the World Resources Institute in Washington DC. I'm the technical lead and web architect for our core institutional sites. Before that I worked for the Scholarly Technology Group at GW Libraries in Drupal, Omeka, and a little Ruby on Rails, and I was the technical lead for their content management systems (like this https://library.gwu.edu).

My first stabs at web development were in the late 90s when I was the Director of Hubris Games.

I've worked in PHP, HTML, CSS/SASS, JS/jQuery, SQL, Ruby on Rails and the occasional Python/Django app. Mostly I work with Drupal.

I've even made a (very small) contribution to Drupal core:

  <div style="width: 354px; margin: 1em auto 1em; max-width: 100%;"><img src="../assets/contrib.jpg" alt="screenshot of my contribution status on drupal.org" /></div>

I have a sandbox module on Drupal.org https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/studiozut/2303677 and have contributed to the Sufia repository project (part of the Hydra Project https://projecthydra.org) https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia.

<h3>About Jekyll</h3>

I built this using Jekyll and github pages, a simple and low maintenance way to build and maintain a content management system. My old team at GW Libraries runs a workshop on this!

You can see my implementation of Jekyll on github: <a href="https://github.com/StudioZut/studiozut.github.io">https://github.com/StudioZut/studiozut.github.io</a>

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for the new Jekyll theme at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
