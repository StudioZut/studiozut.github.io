The term <span style="font-style:italic;">web presence</span> gets thrown around a lot, so what does it really mean? In my case it's a little corner of the "interwebs" for my professional info, a few posts and my general identity as a web developer. My other personal sites ("web presencae?") have a different focus: things like dice and paper roleplaying games! You can see some of that madness here: <a href="https://www.telrhin.com">telrhin.com</a>.  

I built this using Jekyll and github pages, a simple and low maintenance way to build and maintain a WCMS (web content management system). My team runs a workshop on this!

<h3>Web Development</h3>

I'm a full stack Drupal developer for the World Resources Institute in Washington DC. Before that I worked for the Scholarly Technology Group at GW Libraries in Drupal, Omeka, and a little Ruby on Rails, and I was the technical lead for their content management systems (like this https://library.gwu.edu).

I work in PHP, HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery, SQL, Ruby on Rails and the occasional Python/Django app.

I've even made a (very very small) contribution to Drupal core:

  <div style="width: 354px; margin: 1em auto 1em; max-width: 100%;"><img src="../assets/contrib.jpg" alt="screenshot of my contribution status on drupal.org" /></div>

I have a sandbox module on Drupal.org https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/studiozut/2303677 and have contributed to the Sufia repository project (part of the Hydra Project https://projecthydra.org) https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia.

<h3>About Jekyll</h3>

You can see my implementation of Jekyll on github: <a href="https://github.com/StudioZut/studiozut.github.io">https://github.com/StudioZut/studiozut.github.io</a>

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for the new Jekyll theme at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /

You can find the source code for Jekyll at
