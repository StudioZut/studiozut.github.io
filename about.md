<h4>Getting Started</h4>

<div style="float:left; max-width: 20%; min-width: 180px; padding: 0 1em 1em 0;">

</div>

So I needed a web presence, my own little corner of the interwebs for my professional info, posts and general identity as a web developer. My other sites are about other things (like gaming! <a href="https://telrhin.com">telrhin.com</a>). 

I built this using Jekyll and github pages, a simple and low maintenance way to build and maintain a professional presence.

<h4>A Web Developer by Trade</h4>
I'm a full stack developer working at George Washington University's newly formed Libraries & Academic Innovation. I work with Drupal, Omeka, and a little Ruby on Rails, and I'm the technical lead for our content managed systems (like our main Drupal instance at https://library.gwu.edu).

I work in PHP, HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery, SQL, Ruby on Rails and the occasional Python/Django app.

I have a sandbox module on Drupal.org https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/studiozut/2303677 and have contributed to Google's AMP HTML project https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml and the Sufia repository project https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia.
