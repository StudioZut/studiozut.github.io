 <h1>A Primer on Javascript Functions in Four Steps</h1>
  <p><a href="https://codepen.io/studiozut/pen/mjpKLZ">Check out the code in Codepen</a></p>
  <p>This is some text that includes a value created by a function: "<span id="basicVar">this is the text we're replacing with basicFunction</span>".</p>
  <p>And now the same idea, but we're passing a value to the function: "<span id="lessBasicVar">this is the text we're replacing with lessBasicFunction</span>".</p>
  <p>So far so good, but the value "text from a variable" had to be hardcoded into the page (in the body "onload" section). That's not very helpful and we might as well have written it like the basicFunction above. But we passed it a value as a variable, and that's a start. Let's expand on this idea and create a function that takes two values and outputs them as a total. We'll even put a function inside a function for fun using evenLessBasicFunction and output it to the page here: "<span id="evenLessBasicVar">this is the value we're replacing with evenLessBasicFunction</span>"</p> 
    <p>Let's add a form so the user can enter something and we can then use that to pass it to the function.</p>
  <input id="formValue" class="the-class" placeholder="type something here">
  <button id="submitButton">enter</button>
  <p>So now, thanks to the advancedFunction function (and a "listener"), whatever you put in that field should appear here: "<span id="advancedVar">this is the value we're replacing with advancedFunction</span>".</p>
  <p>Now we have four functions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The first function (basicFunction) adds some text to the page</li>
    <li>The second function (lessBasicFunction) also adds text but we get to pass it as a variable</li>
    <li>The third function (evenLessBasicFunction) passes two values and adds them together in a nested function</li>
    <li>The fourth function (advancedFunction) lets us define the value on the page itself</li>
  </ol>
<p>This is all using simple javascript. It's meant to illustrate the logic behind functions and how to pass values to them using variables. There are quicker and better ways to do most of this, like using jquery :).
