For those of you working with (or interested in) Twitter's Bootstrap tools, we've built a "Bootswatch" with the Libraries' lite header.

Twitter Bootstrap is a front-end framework that lets you quickly and easily throw pages or whole websites together with built-in responsive design. To quote them: "Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development." And Bootswatches are design templates for Bootstrap.

Our customized version has the Libraries' branding built in and can be used wherever Libraries has a web presence for consistent branding and flexible mobile-friendly design. 

The code is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/gwu-libraries/Libsite-Header-Lite">https://github.com/gwu-libraries/Libsite-Header-Lite</a>
